# A file for carrying out static analysis. Modifies the AST to be easier to execute, and to track when variables should vanish.

# TODO move 'select' function calls to separate lines,
# TODO code for figuring out which lines run before/after which lines,
# code for tracking variable use, add 'discard' attribute to command nodes for when variables are no longer used.
# TODO aggregate all var names, add mapping of var names to integers.
