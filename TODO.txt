- Implement and maintain proper Sublime Text addon for syntax highlighting.
- Auto-add 'nop' command before and after blocks, as well as after 'if' and 'for'. It's presence will make sure that discards happen at the right time.
- Better 'return' handling, with improved command-line flags for control (mean,median,mode) maybe?
- Documentation and code samples
- Clean up command-line args. Soo many.
